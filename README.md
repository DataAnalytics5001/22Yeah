# Transfer Learning from User’s App Profile to Content Profile

## Introduction and Objectives
Given a mobile user’s mobile App usage profile, including region, mobile app
usage pattern, and overlapping content consumption behavior, use Deep
Learning to predict the user’s content profile using the only app profile, which
means inferring the user’s most interesting articles on the basis of mobile app
behavior and content reading behavior. The objective of our project is to predict
the preference of users on given articles and recommend each user top-five
articles that the user may interested in.
